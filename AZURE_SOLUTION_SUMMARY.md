# Azure Blob Storage Integration - Solution Summary

## Problem Statement
After a week of difficulties loading models from Azure Blob Storage, the main issues were:
1. Complex authentication mixing Azure SAS tokens with Autodesk authentication
2. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when accessing Azure directly from the browser
3. Incorrect URL handling and path resolution for SVF resources
4. Viewer expecting specific directory structures that weren't maintained

## Solution Overview

### 1. Simplified Viewer Component
Created `azureSimpleViewer.js` that:
- Uses a dummy access token callback since Azure files don't need Autodesk authentication
- Loads models through the proxy endpoint to avoid CORS issues
- Provides clear error messages for troubleshooting

### 2. Enhanced Proxy Controller
Updated `AzureSvfProxyController.cs` to:
- Accept any path pattern (not just `/svf/`)
- Handle both full URLs and relative paths
- Automatically detect and serve correct content types
- Generate SAS tokens with appropriate permissions

### 3. Key Architecture Decisions

#### Use Proxy Pattern
Instead of direct browser-to-Azure requests:
```
Browser → Your Server (Proxy) → Azure Blob Storage
```

Benefits:
- No CORS issues
- Centralized authentication
- Request logging and monitoring
- Path normalization

#### Maintain SVF Structure
SVF files must maintain their directory structure:
```
model/
├── bubble.json (manifest)
├── output/
│   ├── geometry/
│   ├── materials/
│   └── properties/
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Store SVF Files in Azure
```bash
# Upload maintaining directory structure
models/
├── MRConfigurator/
│   ├── bubble.json
│   └── output/
│       └── [svf files]
```

### 2. Configure Azure Access
```json
{
  "AzureBlobStorage": {
    "ConnectionString": "...",
    "ContainerName": "models"
  }
}
```

### 3. Use the Viewer
```javascript
<AzureSimpleViewer
    azureBubbleUrl="MRConfigurator/bubble.json"
    onModelLoaded={() => console.log('Success')}
/>
```

## Why This Works

1. **Proxy Handles Complexity**: The server-side proxy manages Azure authentication, eliminating client-side token handling
2. **Standard Viewer Flow**: The viewer loads bubble.json normally, just from a different source
3. **Transparent Path Resolution**: The proxy resolves relative paths in SVF files automatically
4. **No CORS Issues**: All requests go through your domain

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Model not loading | Check bubble.json path in Azure |
| 404 errors | Verify all SVF files uploaded |
| CORS errors | Ensure using proxy URL, not direct Azure URL |
| Auth errors | Check Azure connection string/SAS token |

## Next Steps

1. Test with your specific models using the demo page
2. Monitor proxy logs for any path resolution issues
3. Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed models
4. Add Azure CDN for better global performance
