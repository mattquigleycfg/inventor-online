# Azure Integration Cleanup Summary

## Verification Results

### 1. Azure CLI Credentials ✓
- Connected to Azure subscription: "Azure subscription 1"
- Tenant: Con-form Group Pty Ltd
- Storage Account: conform3d
- Container: models

### 2. Configuration Keys ✓
All required keys are properly set in `appsettings.Local.json`:
- Connection String: Configured with full access
- Container Name: "models"
- SAS URL: Valid until 2029

### 3. Autodesk APS Package Updates ✓
Updated to latest versions:
- `Autodesk.Forge`: 1.9.9 (specified exact version)
- `Autodesk.Authentication`: 2.0.1 (already latest)
- `Autodesk.Oss`: 2.2.3 (already latest)
- `Autodesk.ModelDerivative`: 2.2.0 (already latest)
- `Autodesk.DataManagement`: 2.0.1 (already latest)
- `Autodesk.Forge.DesignAutomation`: 6.0.2 (updated from 4.*)
- `Autodesk.SDKManager`: 1.1.2 (added for new SDK support)

### 4. Code Cleanup ✓

#### Removed Redundant Files:
- `azureTestPage.js` - Minimal wrapper, redundant
- `azureOptimizedViewer.js` - Complex implementation replaced by simpler version

#### Consolidated Azure Service Methods:
- Removed duplicate methods in `AzureBlobService.cs`
- `DownloadModelAsync` → now uses `DownloadBlobAsync`
- `ModelExistsAsync` → now uses `BlobExistsAsync`
- `GetModelUrlAsync` → now uses `GenerateSasUrlAsync`

#### Simplified Configuration:
- Removed duplicate Azure configuration entries in `appsettings.json`
- Streamlined connection string vs SAS token logic
- Clear priority: Connection String > Environment Variables > Config

#### Enhanced Proxy Controller:
- Updated `AzureSvfProxyController` to handle any path pattern
- Added support for both direct URLs and relative paths
- Better error handling and logging

### 5. Debug Tools Added ✓
- Created `AzureController.cs` for status and debugging endpoints
- Created `azureDebugPanel.js` for testing Azure integration
- Endpoints for checking configuration, listing files, and testing access

### 6. Current Azure Storage Status ✓
Files found in storage:
- MRConfigurator.zip (37.9 MB)
- RF Joist.zip (18.6 MB)
- GalaxyConfigurator.zip uploads

**Important Finding**: The models are stored as ZIP files, not extracted SVF structures. This explains why bubble.json paths weren't found.

```

## Next Steps

1. **Extract SVF Files**: The models in Azure are ZIP files. They need to be:
   - Downloaded and extracted
   - Re-uploaded with proper SVF directory structure
   - Or use the Model Derivative API to generate SVF files

2. **Test with Debug Panel**: Use the new `azureDebugPanel.js` to:
   - Verify Azure connectivity
   - Test proxy endpoints
   - Find correct SVF paths

3. **Update Documentation**: The guides assume SVF files are already extracted in Azure

## Key Improvements

1. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed 2 redundant components and consolidated duplicate methods
2. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced logging and error messages throughout
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Single source of truth for Azure settings
4. **Debug Capabilities**: New tools to troubleshoot Azure integration issues
5. **Updated Dependencies**: Using latest Autodesk APS packages

## Configuration Priority

1. Connection String in `appsettings.Local.json` (highest priority)
2. Environment variables (AZURE_BLOB_*)
3. Configuration files (fallback)

The integration is now cleaner, more maintainable, and ready for testing with properly structured SVF files in Azure storage.
